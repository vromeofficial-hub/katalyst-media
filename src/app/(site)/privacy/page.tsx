              We do not operate an account system or store enquiry submissions in a
              website database. The personal information we receive is generally
              limited to what people choose to share when getting in touch, together
              with basic technical information created when the website is used.

          <Section id="lawful-bases" title="6. Lawful bases for processing">
            <p>
              Where UK GDPR applies, we rely on the lawful basis that best matches
              the activity, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — responding to business
                enquiries, operating and securing the website, and keeping ordinary
                business records, where this does not override your rights
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Steps at your request before a contract</strong> —
                discussing a potential campaign after you get in touch
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance of a contract</strong> — where we have agreed to
                provide services to you
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal obligation</strong> — where we must retain or disclose
                information to comply with the law
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consent</strong> — only where consent is specifically
                required (for example, for a non-essential cookie or similar
                technology, if one is introduced)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We do not rely on consent for every activity described in this policy.

          <Section id="enquiries" title="7. Enquiries and communications">
            <p>
              The website includes a Contact section with a Get In Touch call to
              action. Depending on how the site is configured, that may open your
              email client or take you to the Contact section so you can get in
              touch.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no contact form that stores submissions in our application
              database. If you email or message us, the information you include will
              be handled as ordinary business correspondence so we can reply and,
              where relevant, discuss possible work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Submitting an enquiry or starting a conversation does not, by itself,
              create a client contract. Separate terms would apply to any agreed
              campaign work.

          >
            <p>
              At the time of writing, this website does not use Google Analytics,
              Meta Pixel, or similar third-party analytics or advertising pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like most websites, the hosting environment may generate technical
              logs when pages or media are requested. Those logs can include items
              such as IP address, browser user-agent, requested path, and timing
              information. They are used for operating, securing and troubleshooting
              the website rather than for advertising profiling.
            </p>
            <p>
              The site may also use the browser’s session storage for limited
              functional purposes (for example, remembering a section to scroll to
              after navigation). That is not used to build marketing profiles.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section
            id="third-party-content"

          >
            <p>
              The homepage may show short-form video examples associated with
              platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. Those examples are generally
              delivered through our own website as HTML5 video media (including via
              first-party media routes on this site), rather than as live TikTok or
              Instagram embed players loaded in your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means viewing those examples on this website does not, by itself,
              mean TikTok or Instagram receive the same kind of visitor interaction
              data that their official embed widgets would typically collect.
              Behind the scenes, our servers may retrieve media from third-party
              sources in order to display it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website may still refer to, link to, or display branding or
              content connected with third-party platforms (including TikTok,
              Instagram / Meta, Spotify, YouTube and music streaming services). If
              you follow a link to an external platform, that platform’s own privacy
              notice and terms will apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ownership of third-party creator videos, music, trademarks and platform
              branding remains with the relevant rights holders.

          <Section id="cookies" title="10. Cookies and similar technologies">
            <p>
              Based on the current website implementation, we do not set our own
              non-essential analytics or advertising cookies, and there is no cookie
              consent banner because we are not presently using non-essential
              tracking cookies for marketing analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your browser or our hosting provider may still use strictly necessary
              or technical mechanisms needed to deliver pages securely and reliably.
              The site may also use session storage for limited functional
              navigation behaviour, as described above.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we later introduce non-essential cookies or similar tracking
              technologies, we will update this policy and, where required, provide
              an appropriate consent mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can usually control cookies through your browser settings. Blocking
              some cookies may affect how websites work.

          <Section id="sharing" title="11. Sharing information with third parties">
            <p>
              We do not sell personal information. We may share information only

            </ul>
            <p>
              Any service providers we use are expected to handle personal
              information only as needed to provide their services to us.

            <p>
              Some service providers that help us operate the website or
              communications (including hosting infrastructure) may process
              information outside the United Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where personal information is transferred internationally and UK data
              protection law requires it, we take steps to ensure appropriate
              safeguards are in place. The exact mechanism can depend on the
              provider and the circumstances.

          <Section id="retention" title="13. How long information is retained">
            <p>
              We keep personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary
              for the purpose it was collected, including to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>handle enquiries</li>
              <li>manage business relationships</li>

            <p>
              Retention periods vary with the type of information and the nature of
              the relationship. Hosting and security logs are typically kept for a
              shorter operational period; enquiry correspondence may be kept for
              longer as part of ordinary business records.

              We take reasonable technical and organisational steps to help protect
